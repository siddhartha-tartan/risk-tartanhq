      "description": "Most documents consistently report the applicant’s name as 'Goutam Singh', date of birth as '27/12/1992', and PAN number as 'DNFPS9282F'. For example, the Aditya Birla Finance Personal Loan Application, the Aadhaar excerpt, and the Microtek payslip all show these details. (Note: The TransUnion CIBIL report shows the name as 'GOUTAM NULL SINGH', which appears to be an OCR error rather than a true discrepancy.)",

In contrast, both the HDFC bank statement and the Aadhaar document show the address as 'Near Co-operative Victorai Colliery, 4 No Dhauda, Kulti M, Barddhaman, 713343'. This difference may indicate that the applicant is currently residing at a rented or temporary accommodation; it is advisable to verify the reasons for the current address inconsistency.",

This high volume of enquiries could indicate that the applicant has applied for multiple lines of credit recently.

Given a monthly income of approximately ₹39,550, a low end‐of‐period balance may indicate high expenditure or liquidity constraints that require further examination.",
